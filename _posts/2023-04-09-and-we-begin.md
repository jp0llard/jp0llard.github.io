This blog is a space to tell the world about With Other People! The act of storytelling is healing. As Shayda Kafai says in her book "Crip Kinship: The Disability Justice & Art Activism of Sins Invalid", 

> “It [storytelling] results in the storyteller bearing witness to themselves while also inviting others to access that same awareness and vulnerability.” 

My wish is that you feel seen in the stories shared here and that they inspire you to fight for the worlds you dream of.
