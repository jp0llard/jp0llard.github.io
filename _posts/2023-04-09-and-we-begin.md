This website is a space I’ve created to share conversations with dear friends and collaborators in a series called “With Other People.” The act of storytelling is healing. As Shayda Kafai says in her book "Crip Kinship: The Disability Justice & Art Activism of Sins Invalid", 

    “It [storytelling] results in the storyteller bearing witness to themselves while also inviting others to access that same  
    awareness and vulnerability.” 

My wish is that you feel seen in the stories shared here and that they inspire you to fight for the worlds you dream of.
