With Other People is a space for:
- Deaf and disabled people to thrive
- Creative resistance to the status quo
- Alignment of intentions, actions, and outcomes

How we work (our process) is equally important as what we produce (our product).

The kinds of work that I do with partners to build trust, capacity, and confidence in building inclusive learning environments includes:
- Access Accommodation Planning
- Training/Workshop Facilitation 
- Custom Resource Creation
- Evaluation
- Sustainable Community Engagement/Audience Building
- Project Management
