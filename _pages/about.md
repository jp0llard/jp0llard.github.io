In the "With Other People" interview series I share conversations with friends and colleagues who have been instrumental in helping me survive and thrive throughout my career in schools and cultural spaces. It is an opportunity to express gratitude for the difference they've made in my life, while also sharing practical advice for how they do their work in deeply collaborative ways. I hope that reading these interviews leaves you with a generative and momentum-filled feeling. 

You might be thinking, "Wait...is this a podcast?" Great question! Podcasts are a sound-based medium for storytelling that excludes many of Deaf and hard-of-hearing chosen family and colleagues. I decided to choose a medium that was more fully accessible to those being interviewed as well as those who engage with the conversations.
