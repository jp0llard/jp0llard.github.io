The “With Other People” series is co-created with those people who helped me to survive and to thrive in my career. It is an opportunity to express gratitude for the difference they’ve made in my life. But it is also a space to share practical advice for how they do their work in deeply collaborative ways. As you read these interviews, I hope you experience the warm and generative buzzing I felt while editing the conversations. 

You might be thinking, “Wait…is this a podcast?” Great question! Podcasts are sound based format for storytelling that excludes many of my Deaf friends and chosen family. Instead of a podcast, I chose to create a text-based interview series. This medium is more fully accessible to the people I plan to interview as well as those who I hope will engage with the conversations.
